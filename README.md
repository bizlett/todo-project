Bugs

- getDate to show short month, day, (year??) - probably need to create arrays and pull from array? 

- once you delete a todo, the add function doesn't work again unless you refresh the page

- deleteTodo deletes all the todos

Todos

revisit where the toggle all should go! Make a decision!

style inputTodo so that border extends round + button, making it look like its inside the box

li delete button and check button on dynamically created elements - figure out wtf is happening here

complete todo (linethrough) function on checking check box - will need to add completed/active class to it for filters to pick up?

remove element on click delete button - function to be written combined with complete todo because both have on click event listener on ul. if else.  

doubleclick to edit li 




Code

[W3Schools - Toggle Switch](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_switch.asp) - for the Switch button (may change this)

[Dev Ed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttf3CEsEwMQ&t=1996s) - for the addTodo function. Walkthrough was supremely helpful for my understanding and provided a foundation from which to write the other functions myself.
