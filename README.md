Bugs

- getDate to show short month, day, (year??) - probably need to create arrays and pull from array? 

- once you delete a todo, the add function doesn't work again unless you refresh the page

- deleteTodo deletes all the todos

Todos

revisit where the toggle all should go! html/css a bit buggy

style delete button and check button


Code

[W3Schools - Toggle Switch](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_switch.asp) - for the Switch button (may change this)

[Dev Ed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttf3CEsEwMQ&t=1996s) - for the addTodo function. Walkthrough was supremely helpful for my understanding and provided a foundation from which to write the other functions myself.
